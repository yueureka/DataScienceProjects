# Project: Image Classifier with Deep Neural Network
In this project, an image classifier is trained to recognize different species of flowers.This [dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) is used with total 102 flower categories.

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

1. Load and preprocess the image dataset
2. Train the image classifier on your dataset
3. Use the trained classifier to predict image content

# Installation
The code runs in Python 3, Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn and matplotlib are used in the code. Pytorch and Keras are used to train the model, and GPU mode is applied during the training process.
