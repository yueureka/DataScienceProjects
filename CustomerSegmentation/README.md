# Introduction

In this project, we are going to solve a real-life data science project on customer segmentation and targeting advertising. Demographics data and the customer data of mail-order sales in Germany are provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. Firstly, unsupervised learning techniques are applied to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, the third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company is provided, and supervised learning models are used to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. 

The results of the prediction are uploaded to [Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/udacity-arvato-identify-customers).

The report for this project is posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yueureka/customer-segmentation-report-for-arvato-financial-services-858134126acd).
