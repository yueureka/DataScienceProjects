# Data Science Blog: Global Suicite Rate Trend Analysis
In this project, dataset of suicide rate from 1985-2015 globally is analyzed. The findings and insights from the analysis are posted on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yueureka/the-richer-the-happier-suicide-rate-tells-you-no-b63ca21b0aa4). 

# Installation
The code runs in Python 3, Python libraries like pandas, numpy and matplotlib are used in the code. 

# Motivation 
The dataset that contains the global suicide number from 1985-2015 is investigated. In the dataset, features like country, year, sex, age, suicides number, population, GDP of the countries are listed. Based on the dataset, several interesting insights are provided:
1. Is there any relation between the global suicide rate and GDP during the time span?
2. What’s the suicide rate between males and females?
3. What’s the suicide rate at different age?
4. Which counties have the highest and lowest suicide rate?
5. Between United States and Mexico, which country has a higher suicide rate?

# File Descriptions
